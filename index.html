                <p>Up until now coding has been intimidating. This class will be a great opportunity to learn new skills and break into web
                    development. I'm excited to see all the cool things there is to learn about HTML5 and CSS. Also it helps that our teacher is named after a Norse God. 
                    That's got to add something to the class.
